# Avenire visual guidelines for terminal agents

You are using Avenire's visual creation guidelines outside the Avenire chat runtime. Apply these rules when generating visual artifacts in pi, Codex, Grok Build, Claude Code, or any terminal coding agent.

## Runtime adaptation

Avenire's original guidelines assume a `show_widget` tool with either `widget.type: "spec"` or `widget.type: "code"`. In terminal agents, adapt as follows:

- If the host provides `show_widget`, use it exactly as described below.
- If no widget tool exists, create a standalone artifact file instead:
  - Raw SVG diagrams or illustrations: write an `.svg` file.
  - Interactive explainers, Chart.js visuals, dashboards, or UI mockups: write a self-contained `.html` file.
  - Primitive/spec artifacts: write the JSON spec to `.json`, or translate it into equivalent HTML if the user needs something viewable in a browser.
- Prefer creating files over dumping large code in chat when the user asks to build, implement, or generate an artifact.
- Preserve the visual constraints below even outside Avenire: sentence case, compact labels, dark-mode-safe tokens/classes where applicable, no generic AI styling, no decorative gradients/shadows, no emoji, and careful SVG layout math.
- If the target project does not expose Avenire CSS variables/classes, define a minimal local theme in the artifact that maps the documented variables/classes to neutral light/dark-safe values. Keep the look flat, quiet, and native.
- Do not use or include any study-guideline skills. This skill is visual-guidelines only.

## Source bundle

This global skill is generated from `packages/ai/skills/sections/visual-guidelines/` in the Avenire repo. It intentionally excludes `study-guidelines`.

# Imagine — Visual Creation Suite


<!-- Source: packages/ai/skills/sections/visual-guidelines/modules.md -->

## Modules
Call `visualize_read_me` again with the relevant visual modules when you need more specific guidance:
- `diagram` — SVG flowcharts, structural diagrams, illustrative diagrams
- `mockup` — UI mockups, forms, cards, dashboards. Prefer `widget.type: "spec"` primitives unless pixel-specific HTML is required.
- `interactive` — interactive explainers with controls. Prefer `widget.type: "spec"` for static/structured explainers; use raw HTML for controls and custom JS.
- `chart` — charts and data analysis. Use `widget.type: "spec"` first for bar, line, area, stats, tables, callouts, and dashboard/report layouts. Raw Chart.js is only for unsupported chart types or imperative chart interaction.
- `art` — illustration and generative art
- `physics` — physics simulations, motion, forces, energy, and time-evolving systems
Pick the closest fit. Each module includes the relevant design guidance.

**Default artifact rule:** if the answer includes a report, dashboard, comparison matrix, status summary, card grid, metric row, chart, callout, progress readout, or table that should stand alone, call `show_widget` with `widget: { type: "spec", spec: ... }`. Plain markdown is fine for a small table embedded in a normal prose answer; spec tables are for artifact-style reports where scanning and layout matter.

**Complexity budget — hard limits:**
- Box subtitles: ≤5 words. Detail goes in click-through (`sendPrompt`) or the prose below — not the box.
- Colors: ≤2 ramps per diagram. If colors encode meaning (states, tiers), add a 1-line legend. Otherwise use one neutral ramp.
- Horizontal tier: ≤4 boxes at full width (~140px each). 5+ boxes → shrink to ≤110px OR wrap to 2 rows OR split into overview + detail diagrams.

If you catch yourself writing "click to learn more" in prose, the diagram itself must ACTUALLY be sparse. Don't promise brevity then front-load everything.

You create rich visual content — first-class primitive canvases, SVG diagrams/illustrations, and HTML interactive widgets — that renders inline in conversation. The best output feels like a natural extension of the chat.


<!-- Source: packages/ai/skills/sections/visual-guidelines/core_design_system.md -->

## Core Design System

These rules apply to ALL use cases.

### Philosophy
- **Seamless**: Users shouldn't notice where claude.ai ends and your widget begins.
- **Primitive-first**: For canvas-style artifacts, use `show_widget` with `widget: { type: "spec", spec: ... }` first-class primitives. They render with Avenire's shadcn UI components and are the default for cards, metrics, tables, sections, charts, callouts, and structured reports.
- **Raw-code escape hatch**: Use `show_widget` with `widget: { type: "code", code: ... }` raw HTML/SVG only when the widget needs custom drawing, custom interaction, canvas animation, imperative JS, mermaid, or third-party libraries.
- **Compact but complete**: Inline widgets should stay compact. Canvas artifacts may include concise headings, labels, callouts, and tables inside the widget when that content is part of the artifact.
- **No duplicated prose**: Full explanations belong in the chat response. The widget may contain short artifact text that helps the visual stand alone.
- **Use the system as-is**: do not invent your own styling language for primitive widgets. Reuse the provided primitive nodes and theme tokens. Treat them as a contract, not inspiration.

### Streaming
Output streams token-by-token. Structure code so useful content appears early.
- **HTML**: `<style>` (short) → content HTML → `<script>` last.
- **SVG**: `<defs>` (markers) → visual elements immediately.
- Prefer inline `style="..."` over `<style>` blocks — inputs/controls must look correct mid-stream.
- Keep `<style>` under ~15 lines. Interactive widgets with inputs and sliders need more style rules — that's fine, but don't bloat with decorative CSS.
- Gradients, shadows, and blur flash during streaming DOM diffs. Use solid flat fills instead.

### Rules
- No `<!-- comments -->` or `/* comments */` (waste tokens, break streaming)
- No font-size below 11px
- No emoji — use CSS shapes or SVG paths
- No gradients, drop shadows, blur, glow, or neon effects
- **No hand-authored UI colors.** Do not pick colors for primitive widgets. Use `tone` and built-in chart defaults. Raw SVG/canvas may use CSS variables and documented SVG classes; only use hardcoded colors for domain-specific physical illustrations where the color carries meaning.
- **Classes first.** If a provided classname solves the problem, use the classname. Do not recreate the same look with inline color/fill/stroke declarations.
- **Do not restyle core components from scratch.** Inputs, buttons, sliders, cards, pills, metric blocks, and diagram nodes should follow the prescribed structure. If a primitive exists, use it instead of recreating it in HTML.
- **Layout styles are allowed; appearance styles are not.** Use inline CSS for positioning, spacing, sizing, and grid/flex layout. Do not use inline CSS to invent new visual design for components.
- No dark/colored backgrounds on outer containers (transparent only — host provides the bg)
- **Typography**: The default font is var(--font-sans). For the rare editorial/blockquote moment, use `font-family: var(--font-serif)`.
- **Headings**: h1 = 22px, h2 = 18px, h3 = 16px — all `font-weight: 500`. Heading color is pre-set to `var(--color-text-primary)` — don't override it. Body text = 16px, weight 400, `line-height: 1.7`. **Two weights only: 400 regular, 500 bold.** Never use 600 or 700 — they look heavy against the host UI.
- **Sentence case** always. Never Title Case, never ALL CAPS. This applies everywhere including SVG text labels and diagram headings.
- **No mid-sentence bolding**, including in your response text around the tool call. Entity names, class names, function names go in `code style` not **bold**. Bold is for headings and labels only.
- The widget container is `display: block; width: 100%`. Your HTML fills it naturally — no wrapper div needed. Just start with your content directly. If you want vertical breathing room, add `padding: 1rem 0` on your first element.
- Never use `position: fixed` — the iframe viewport sizes itself to your in-flow content height, so fixed-positioned elements (modals, overlays, tooltips) collapse it to `min-height: 100px`. For modal/overlay mockups: wrap everything in a normal-flow `<div style="min-height: 400px; background: rgba(0,0,0,0.45); display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">` and put the modal inside — it's a faux viewport that actually contributes layout height.
- No DOCTYPE, `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` — just content fragments.
- When placing text on a colored background (badges, pills, cards, tags), use the darkest shade from that same color family for the text — never plain black or generic gray.
- **Corners**: use `border-radius: var(--border-radius-md)` (or `-lg` for cards) in HTML. In SVG, `rx="4"` is the default — larger values make pills, use only when you mean a pill.
- **No rounded corners on single-sided borders** — if using `border-left` or `border-top` accents, set `border-radius: 0`. Rounded corners only work with full borders on all sides.
- **Titles and concise artifact text are allowed in spec widgets**. For raw SVG diagrams, keep prose outside the tool unless the text is a direct label in the diagram.
- **Icon sizing**: When using emoji or inline SVG icons, explicitly set `font-size: 16px` for emoji or `width: 16px; height: 16px` for SVG icons. Never let icons inherit the container's font size — they will render too large. For larger decorative icons, use 24px max.
- No tabs, carousels, or `display: none` sections during streaming — hidden content streams invisibly. Show all content stacked vertically. (Post-streaming JS-driven steppers are fine — see Illustrative/Interactive sections.)
- No nested scrolling — auto-fit height.
- Scripts execute after streaming — load libraries via `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/...">` (UMD globals), then use the global in a plain `<script>` that follows.
- **CDN allowlist (CSP-enforced)**: external resources may ONLY load from `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, `esm.sh`, `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `unpkg.com`. All other origins are blocked by the sandbox — the request silently fails.

### Quality gate
Before calling `show_widget`, run this mental review. If any item fails, revise the widget first.

- **Contrast:** every text label, axis label, stroke, dot, and control readout must be readable in both light and dark mode. Do not draw near-black marks on a near-black canvas or near-white marks on a white canvas. Use `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-border-secondary`, semantic tokens, or the canvas theme variables instead.
- **Ink density:** the main visual should have enough visible structure to be understood at a glance. Avoid tiny sparse dots, hairline strokes, and unlabeled marks as the only signal. Primary marks should normally be at least 2px strokes or 5px dots in CSS pixels; secondary guides can be lighter but still visible.
- **Native controls:** buttons, sliders, inputs, and readouts must look like the host UI. Use bare form tags or the documented component recipes. Do not make bright custom-filled buttons unless the host component already provides that treatment.
- **Alignment:** controls must sit in clear rows with labels, inputs, and values aligned. Avoid loose labels floating beside sliders or values detached from the variable they describe.
- **Responsive fit:** no text should overlap, clip, or depend on one fixed canvas size. Use `ResizeObserver`, CSS grid with `minmax(0, 1fr)`, and measured canvas layout.
- **Self-check labels:** if a user cannot tell what the x-axis, y-axis, markers, and current state mean without reading the chat response, add short in-widget labels.
- **No dim placeholders:** a widget must not look like a loading skeleton after it has rendered. Avoid low-opacity whole-widget styling, under-contrasted canvases, or empty panels with only faint marks.

### CSS Variables
**Backgrounds**: `--color-background-primary` (white), `-secondary` (surfaces), `-tertiary` (page bg), `-info`, `-danger`, `-success`, `-warning`
**Text**: `--color-text-primary` (black), `-secondary` (muted), `-tertiary` (hints), `-info`, `-danger`, `-success`, `-warning`
**Borders**: `--color-border-tertiary` (0.15α, default), `-secondary` (0.3α, hover), `-primary` (0.4α), semantic `-info/-danger/-success/-warning`
**Typography**: `--font-sans`, `--font-serif`, `--font-mono`
**Layout**: `--border-radius-md` (8px), `--border-radius-lg` (12px — preferred for most components), `--border-radius-xl` (16px)
All auto-adapt to light/dark mode. These are the only allowed theme primitives. Do not invent additional color values.

The shared UI theme also exposes palette families through:
- `--color-text-default|gray|brown|orange|yellow|green|blue|purple|pink|red`
- `--color-bg-default|gray|brown|orange|yellow|green|blue|purple|pink|red`
- `--color-pill-default|gray|brown|orange|yellow|green|blue|purple|pink|red`

**Dark mode is mandatory** — every color must work in both modes:
- In SVG: use the pre-built color classes (`c-default`, `c-gray`, `c-brown`, `c-orange`, `c-yellow`, `c-green`, `c-blue`, `c-purple`, `c-pink`, `c-red`, plus aliases `c-teal`, `c-amber`, `c-coral`) for colored nodes — they handle light/dark mode automatically. Never write `<style>` blocks for colors.
- In SVG: every `<text>` element needs a class (`t`, `ts`, `th`) — never omit fill or use `fill="inherit"`. Inside a `c-{color}` parent, text classes auto-adjust to the ramp.
- In HTML: use the provided component styles and theme tokens only. Never hardcode colors like `#333`, and do not invent your own palette choices.
- Mental test: if the background were near-black, would every text element still be readable?

### sendPrompt(text)
A global function that sends a message to chat as if the user typed it. Use it when the user's next step benefits from Claude thinking. Handle filtering, sorting, toggling, and calculations in JS instead.

### Links
`<a href="https://...">` just works — clicks are intercepted and open the host's link-confirmation dialog. Or call `openLink(url)` directly.

## When nothing fits
Pick the closest use case below and adapt. When nothing fits cleanly:
- Default to editorial layout if the content is explanatory
- Default to card layout if the content is a bounded object
- All core design system rules still apply
- Use `sendPrompt()` for any action that benefits from Claude thinking

# First-class widget primitives

Prefer `show_widget` with `widget: { type: "spec", spec: ... }` for canvas-style artifacts: debugging reports, docs canvases, learning dashboards, comparison cards, metric summaries, tables, charts, timelines, and structured explanations. The app renders spec widgets with first-class React components backed by `@avenire/ui` shadcn primitives, so the result inherits the host theme, spacing, cards, tables, badges, progress bars, and chart styling.

Use `widget: { type: "code", code: ... }` only when the visual needs custom SVG geometry, canvas drawing, imperative animation, DOM event handling, sliders, steppers, simulations, mermaid, or third-party libraries. If the artifact is mostly layout, text, metrics, tables, cards, or simple charts, use a spec widget.

## Tool shape

Call `show_widget` with a `widget` object. For primitive widgets, use `type: "spec"` and put the primitive tree in `spec`.

```json
{
  "i_have_seen_read_me": true,
  "title": "Websocket pool leak debug",
  "widget": {
    "type": "spec",
    "spec": {
      "title": "Websocket pool leak debug",
      "description": "Incident view with request, connection, memory, and milestone evidence.",
      "root": {
        "type": "stack",
        "gap": "lg",
        "children": []
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available nodes

- `stack`: vertical composition. Fields: `children`, optional `gap` (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).
- `grid`: responsive grid. Fields: `children`, optional `columns` (1-4), optional `gap`.
- `section`: open section with optional `title`, `description`, and `children`. Use to avoid a wall of identical cards.
- `card`: bounded surface with optional `title`, `description`, `tone`, and `children`.
- `stat`: metric card. Fields: `label`, `value`, optional `delta`, optional `tone`.
- `heading`: text heading. Fields: `text`, optional `level` (`1`, `2`, `3`).
- `text`: paragraph. Fields: `text`, optional `tone`, optional `weight` (`regular`, `medium`).
- `badge`: compact label. Fields: `text`, optional `tone`.
- `callout`: highlighted note. Fields: optional `title`, `text`, `tone`, `children`.
- `table`: data table. Fields: `headers`, `rows`, optional `caption`.
- `chart`: Recharts-backed chart. Fields: `chartType` (`bar`, `line`, `area`), `data`, `indexKey`, `series`, optional `title`.
- `progress`: progress row. Fields: `value` from 0-100, optional `label`.
- `divider`: horizontal separator.
- `code`: code block. Fields: `code`, optional `language`.
- `html`: final escape hatch for a small trusted fragment inside a primitive composition. Prefer not to use it.

Tones: `default`, `muted`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`.

## Composition rules

- Lead with the artifact's answer: a title, a one-line description, then the most important metric, chart, or table.
- Mix open sections with cards. Do not wrap every block in a card.
- Use `grid` for 2-4 stats or option cards. Use `stack` for narrative flow.
- Use `section` for headings and grouping; use `card` for bounded objects that should feel like one unit.
- Keep card titles short and sentence case.
- Prefer one strong chart plus a compact table over several tiny charts.
- Round all displayed numbers before putting them into the JSON.
- Keep rows compact: tables should usually have 3-6 columns and fewer than 20 rows.
- Use semantic tones sparingly. Most nodes should be neutral; reserve `warning`, `danger`, and `success` for meaning.

## Good pattern

```json
{
  "title": "Resource leak incident",
  "description": "Connections climb after deploy, then recover after rollback.",
  "root": {
    "type": "stack",
    "gap": "lg",
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "grid",
        "columns": 3,
        "children": [
          { "type": "stat", "label": "Peak open connections", "value": "8.4k", "delta": "+6.1k after deploy", "tone": "warning" },
          { "type": "stat", "label": "Failed requests", "value": "1.5k/hr", "delta": "Recovered after rollback", "tone": "danger" },
          { "type": "stat", "label": "Memory at baseline", "value": "08:08", "delta": "Hotfix stable", "tone": "success" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "chart",
        "title": "Failed requests per hour",
        "chartType": "area",
        "indexKey": "time",
        "series": [{ "dataKey": "failed", "label": "Failed requests" }],
        "data": [
          { "time": "07:00", "failed": 0 },
          { "time": "07:16", "failed": 240 },
          { "time": "07:20", "failed": 1480 },
          { "time": "08:08", "failed": 12 }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "section",
        "title": "Milestones",
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "table",
            "headers": ["Time", "Event", "Interpretation"],
            "rows": [
              ["07:10", "Deploy v2.14.0", "Connections begin rising"],
              ["07:16", "Alert fired", "Errors and p99 diverge"],
              ["07:20", "Rollback", "Connections and memory fall"]
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Bad pattern

- Do not put a single sentence into a card by itself.
- Do not create a vertical stack of five identical cards.
- Do not use raw HTML for tables, badges, metric cards, or simple charts.
- Do not use decorative tones just to make the canvas colorful.
- Do not duplicate the same explanatory paragraph in chat and in the widget. The widget can contain concise labels and artifact text; the chat response should carry the full explanation.

## UI components

### Aesthetic
Use `widget: { type: "spec", spec: ... }` first for UI-like widgets. It renders with the host's shadcn primitives: cards, badges, tables, metric stats, sections, progress, callouts, and charts. Raw HTML is now the fallback for custom interaction, custom SVG/canvas, or controls that cannot be represented with primitives.

Flat, clean surfaces. Minimal borders. Generous whitespace. Avoid decorative gradients and shadows in primitive widgets. Everything should feel native to Avenire — like it belongs on the page, not embedded from somewhere else.

This section is prescriptive. Do not freestyle component styling. Use spec nodes when available; use the exact HTML recipes only when raw code widgets are necessary.

**Hard rule:** component CSS is for layout only. Do not invent new visual treatments for cards, controls, badges, pills, panels, or tables. If the request maps to a spec widget, use primitives. If it must be raw HTML, copy the closest pattern below.

### Tokens
- Borders: always `0.5px solid var(--color-border-tertiary)` (or `-secondary` for emphasis)
- Corner radius: `var(--border-radius-md)` for most elements, `var(--border-radius-lg)` for cards
- Cards: white bg (`var(--color-background-primary)`), 0.5px border, radius-lg, padding 1rem 1.25rem
- Form elements (input, select, textarea, button, range slider) are pre-styled — write bare tags. Text inputs are 36px with hover/focus built in; range sliders have 4px track + 18px thumb; buttons have outline style with hover/active. Only add inline styles to override (e.g., different width).
- **Do not recolor controls.** Bare tags are preferred because they inherit the system look. Do not repaint buttons, sliders, inputs, or pills with custom colors.
- **No custom component CSS.** Do not add bespoke border systems, shadows, gradients, button skins, custom inputs, glassmorphism, neumorphism, colored cards, or decorative panels.
- Buttons: pre-styled with transparent bg, 0.5px border-secondary, hover bg-secondary, active scale(0.98). If it triggers sendPrompt, append a ↗ arrow.
- **Round every displayed number.** JS float math leaks artifacts — `0.1 + 0.2` gives `0.30000000000000004`, `7 * 1.1` gives `7.700000000000001`. Any number that reaches the screen (slider readouts, stat card values, axis labels, data-point labels, tooltips, computed totals) must go through `Math.round()`, `.toFixed(n)`, or `Intl.NumberFormat`. Pick the precision that makes sense for the context — integers for counts, 1–2 decimals for percentages, `toLocaleString()` for currency. For range sliders, also set `step="1"` (or step="0.1" etc.) so the input itself emits round values.
- Spacing: use rem for vertical rhythm (1rem, 1.5rem, 2rem), px for component-internal gaps (8px, 12px, 16px)
- Box-shadows: none, except `box-shadow: 0 0 0 Npx` focus rings on inputs

### Metric cards
For summary numbers (revenue, count, percentage) — surface card with muted 13px label above, 24px/500 number below. `background: var(--color-background-secondary)`, no border, `border-radius: var(--border-radius-md)`, padding 1rem. Use in grids of 2-4 with `gap: 12px`. Distinct from raised cards (which have white bg + border).

### Layout
- Editorial (explanatory content): no card wrapper, prose flows naturally
- Card (bounded objects like a contact record, receipt): single raised card wraps the whole thing
- Tables in a normal prose answer can be markdown. Tables that are part of a standalone report, dashboard, comparison artifact, or data canvas should be spec `table` nodes.
- If an example below matches the request, copy that structure closely instead of inventing a new component pattern.
- If a layout works with bare semantic tags plus spacing, prefer that over additional classes or styles.

**Grid overflow:** `grid-template-columns: 1fr` has `min-width: auto` by default — children with large min-content push the column past the container. Use `minmax(0, 1fr)` to clamp.

**Table overflow:** Tables with many columns auto-expand past `width: 100%` if cell contents exceed it. In constrained layouts (≤700px), use `table-layout: fixed` and set explicit column widths, or reduce columns, or allow horizontal scroll on a wrapper.

### Mockup presentation
Contained mockups — mobile screens, chat threads, single cards, modals, small UI components — should sit on a background surface (`var(--color-background-secondary)` container with `border-radius: var(--border-radius-lg)` and padding, or a device frame) so they don't float naked on the widget canvas. Full-width mockups like dashboards, settings pages, or data tables that naturally fill the viewport do not need an extra wrapper.

### 1. Interactive explainer — learn how something works
*"Explain how compound interest works" / "Teach me about sorting algorithms"*

Use a spec widget if the explainer is static or only needs metrics, tables, and simple charts. Use raw HTML for interactive controls — sliders, buttons, live state displays, imperative charts. Keep long prose explanations in your normal response text; labels and short artifact text may be inside the widget.

```html
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px; margin: 0 0 1.5rem;">
  <label style="font-size: 14px; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">Years</label>
  <input type="range" min="1" max="40" value="20" id="years" style="flex: 1;" />
  <span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500; min-width: 24px;" id="years-out">20</span>
</div>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: baseline; gap: 8px; margin: 0 0 1.5rem;">
  <span style="font-size: 14px; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">£1,000 →</span>
  <span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 500;" id="result">£3,870</span>
</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; position: relative; height: 240px;">
  <canvas id="chart"></canvas>
</div>
```

Use `sendPrompt()` to let users ask follow-ups: `sendPrompt('What if I increase the rate to 10%?')`

### 2. Compare options — decision making
*"Compare pricing and features of these products" / "Help me choose between React and Vue"*

Use a spec widget with a `grid` of `card` nodes, `badge` nodes for differentiators, and a compact `table` only when rows are the clearest representation. Use raw HTML only if filtering or weighting must happen inside the widget.

- Use `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(160px, 1fr))` for responsive columns
- Each option in a card. Use badges for key differentiators.
- Add `sendPrompt()` buttons: `sendPrompt('Tell me more about the Pro plan')`
- Use spec tables for dense artifact comparisons. Use markdown tables only when the table is small and the answer is otherwise plain prose.
- When one option is recommended or "most popular", accent its card with `border: 2px solid var(--color-border-info)` only (2px is deliberate — the only exception to the 0.5px rule, used to accent featured items) — keep the same background and border as the other cards. Add a small badge (e.g. "Most popular") above or inside the card header using `background: var(--color-background-info); color: var(--color-text-info); font-size: 12px; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: var(--border-radius-md)`.

### 3. Data record — bounded UI object
*"Show me a Salesforce contact card" / "Create a receipt for this order"*

Use a spec widget with a single `card`, short `text` rows, `badge` for status, and `divider` for sections. Use raw HTML only when you need a pixel-specific mockup or custom layout not covered by primitives.

```html

## Color palette

We use a semantic system palette. Instead of picking raw colors yourself, **you must exclusively use the predefined classes and theme tokens**. Do not choose colors. Do not tune colors. Do not "improve" colors. The system already owns that decision.

### Non-negotiable rule

- Never write hex, rgb(), hsl(), oklch(), named colors, or custom gradients for normal UI/diagram styling.
- Never hand-author `fill`, `stroke`, `color`, `background`, or `border-color` values when a provided class or token exists.
- If you are about to pick a color, stop and apply the correct classname instead.

### Actual palette exposed by the app

These are the real palette families available from the shared styles:

- `default`
- `gray`
- `brown`
- `orange`
- `yellow`
- `green`
- `blue`
- `purple`
- `pink`
- `red`

For each family, the app exposes:

- `--color-text-{family}`
- `--color-bg-{family}`
- `--color-pill-{family}`

Examples:

- `var(--color-bg-red)`
- `var(--color-bg-purple)`
- `var(--color-bg-yellow)`
- `var(--color-text-blue)`
- `var(--color-pill-green)`

These come from the shared UI theme and already adapt for light and dark mode. Use them directly when you truly need a token. Do not invent adjacent shades.

### Pre-built Semantic SVG Classes

| Class | Ramp | Semantic Use |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `c-default` | Default | Neutral base, plain content |
| `c-gray` | Gray | Neutral/structural nodes (start, end, generic steps) |
| `c-brown` | Brown | Earthy, muted categories |
| `c-purple` | Purple | General categories, abstract concepts |
| `c-pink` | Pink | General categories |
| `c-blue` | Blue | Informational, primary actions |
| `c-green` | Green | Success states, organic physical properties |
| `c-yellow` | Yellow | Warning states, warm physical properties |
| `c-orange` | Orange | Warm physical properties, accent categories |
| `c-red` | Red | Danger/Error states |
| `c-black` | Foreground/Background contrast | Primary emphasis, binary states (on/off), contrasted nodes |
| `c-teal` | Alias to green tokens | Backward-compatible alias when older examples use teal |
| `c-amber` | Alias to yellow tokens | Backward-compatible alias when older examples use amber |
| `c-coral` | Alias to orange tokens | Backward-compatible alias when older examples use coral |

**How to assign colors**: Color should encode meaning, not sequence. Don't cycle through colors like a rainbow (step 1 = blue, step 2 = amber, step 3 = red...). Instead:
- Group nodes by **category** — all nodes of the same type share one color. E.g. in a vaccine diagram: all immune cells = purple, all pathogens = coral, all outcomes = teal.
- For illustrative diagrams, map colors to **physical properties** — warm ramps for heat/energy, cool for cold/calm, green for organic, gray for structural/inert.
- Use **gray for neutral/structural** nodes (start, end, generic steps).
- Use **2-3 colors per diagram**, not 6+. More colors = more visual noise. A diagram with gray + purple + teal is cleaner than one using every ramp.
- **Prefer purple, teal, coral, pink** for general diagram categories. Reserve blue, green, amber, and red for cases where the node genuinely represents an informational, success, warning, or error concept — those colors carry strong semantic connotations from UI conventions. (Exception: illustrative diagrams may use blue/amber/red freely when they map to physical properties like temperature or pressure.)

### Using Colors

- **In SVG:** Apply `c-{ramp}` to a `<g>` wrapping shape+text, or directly to a `<rect>`/`<circle>`/`<ellipse>`. Never to `<path>` — paths don't get ramp fill. Dark mode is automatic for ramp classes. Supported families: default, gray, brown, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, red. Compatibility aliases: `c-amber` maps to yellow, `c-coral` maps to orange, `c-teal` maps to green.
- **In CSS/HTML:** If you truly need color styling, use the matching theme tokens only: `var(--color-bg-{family})`, `var(--color-text-{family})`, and `var(--color-pill-{family})`. The real families are `default`, `gray`, `brown`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `purple`, `pink`, and `red`.

The WidgetRenderer maps `c-{ramp}` to `var(--color-pill-{ramp})` for the stroke, and `var(--color-bg-{ramp})` for the fill. Therefore, simply applying the class is enough. You do not need custom light/dark mode logic, and you should not write any.

For status/semantic meaning in UI (success, warning, danger) use the system tokens. For categorical coloring in both diagrams and UI, use these ramps. Nothing else.

### Canvas palette

Canvas widgets should not hardcode one palette and hope it survives theme changes. Read colors from the theme contract exposed by `WidgetRenderer`:

- `window.avenireTheme`
- `window.addEventListener("avenire:themechange", ...)`
- CSS variables such as `--canvas-background`, `--canvas-text`, `--canvas-muted`, `--canvas-primary`, `--canvas-grid`

Use the current theme as the source of truth, then redraw the canvas whenever the theme changes. That keeps charts, simulations, and custom renderers readable in both modes.

## SVG setup

**ViewBox safety checklist** — before finalizing any SVG, verify:
1. Find your lowest element: max(y + height) across all rects, max(y) across all text baselines.
2. Set viewBox height = that value + 40px buffer.
3. Find your rightmost element: max(x + width) across all rects. All content must stay within x=0 to x=680.
4. For text with text-anchor="end", the text extends LEFT from x. If x=118 and text is 200px wide, it starts at x=-82 — outside the viewBox. Increase x or use text-anchor="start".
5. Never use negative x or y coordinates. The viewBox starts at 0,0.
6. Flowcharts/structural only: for every pair of boxes in the same row, check that the left box's (x + width) is less than the right box's x by at least 20px. If four 160px boxes plus three 20px gaps sum to more than 640px, the row doesn't fit — shrink the boxes or cut the subtitles, don't let them overlap.
7. If a diagram still feels tight after the math, it is too dense. Split it into multiple diagrams instead of compressing placement.

**SVG setup**: `<svg width="100%" viewBox="0 0 680 H">` — 680px wide, flexible height. Set H to fit content tightly — the last element's bottom edge + 40px padding. Don't leave excess empty space below the content. Safe area: x=40 to x=640, y=40 to y=(H-40). Background transparent. **Do not wrap the SVG in a container `<div>` with a background color** — the widget host already provides the card container and background. Output the raw `<svg>` element directly.

**The 680 in viewBox is load-bearing — do not change it.** It matches the widget container width so SVG coordinate units render 1:1 with CSS pixels. With `width="100%"`, the browser scales the entire coordinate space to fit the container: `viewBox="0 0 480 H"` in a 680px container scales everything by 680/480 = 1.42×, so your `class="th"` 14px text renders at ~20px. The font calibration table below and all "text fits in box" math assume 1:1. If your diagram content is naturally narrow, **keep viewBox width at 680 and center the content** (e.g. content spans x=180..500) — do not shrink the viewBox to hug the content. This applies equally to inline SVGs inside `show_widget` HTML steppers and widgets: same `viewBox="0 0 680 H"`, same 1:1 guarantee.

**viewBox height:** After layout, find max_y (bottom-most point of any shape, including text baselines + 4px descent). Set viewBox height = max_y + 20. Don't guess.

**Default placement discipline** — use these defaults unless you have a specific reason not to:
- Outer margins: 40px on every side
- Horizontal gap between peer boxes: 24px minimum
- Vertical gap between tiers: 32px minimum
- Default node width: 160-200px
- Maximum node width in dense diagrams: 220px
- If you need more than 4 medium boxes in one row, split the diagram
- Prefer right-side labels with `text-anchor="start"`; avoid left-side label columns unless necessary
- Keep connectors orthogonal when possible; straight lines are only for unobstructed short runs

**text-anchor='end' at x<60 is risky** — the longest label will extend left past x=0. Use text-anchor='start' and right-align the column instead, or check: label_chars × 8 < anchor_x.

**One SVG per tool call** — each call must contain exactly one <svg> element. Never leave an abandoned or partial SVG in the output. If your first attempt has problems, replace it entirely — do not append a corrected version after the broken one.

**Few-shot SVG examples must start with a planning block.** Put this comment immediately before the raw SVG in any example:
```text
<!-- PLAN
  type: flowchart | structural | illustrative | interactive
  nodes: list with (label, chars, computed width)
  row widths: sum check
  viewBox H: last_bottom + 40
  label side: right (default) | left (forced by __)
  color ramp: __ for __ , __ for __
-->
```
Fill it out for the example you are showing so the sizing and routing logic is explicit.

**Style rules for all diagrams**:
- Every `<text>` element must carry one of the pre-built classes (`t`, `ts`, `th`). An unclassed `<text>` inherits the default sans font, which is the tell that you forgot the class.
- Use only two font sizes: 14px for node/region labels (class="t" or "th"), 12px for subtitles, descriptions, and arrow labels (class="ts"). No other sizes.
- No decorative step numbers, large numbering, or oversized headings outside boxes.
- No icons or illustrations inside boxes — text only. (Exception: illustrative diagrams may use simple shape-based indicators inside drawn objects — see below.)
- Sentence case on all labels.

**Font size calibration for diagram text labels** - Here's csv table to give you better sense of the var(--font-sans) font rendering width:
```csv
text, chars length, font-weight, font-size, rendered width
Authentication Service, chars: 22, font-weight: 500, font-size: 14px, width: 167px
Background Job Processor, chars: 24, font-weight: 500, font-size: 14px, width: 201px
Detects and validates incoming tokens, chars: 37, font-weight: 400, font-size: 14px, width: 279px
forwards request to, chars: 19, font-weight: 400, font-size: 12px, width: 123px
データベースサーバー接続, chars: 12, font-weight: 400, font-size: 14px, width: 181px
```

Before placing text in a box, check: does (text width + 2×padding) fit the container?

**SVG `<text>` never auto-wraps.** Every line break needs an explicit `<tspan x="..." dy="1.2em">`. If your subtitle is long enough to need wrapping, it's too long — shorten it (see complexity budget).

**Example check**: You want to put "Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)" in a rounded rect. The text is 20 characters at 14px ≈ 180px wide. Add 2×24px padding = 228px minimum box width. If your rect is only 160px wide, the text WILL overflow — either shorten the label (e.g. just "Glucose") or widen the box. Subscript characters like ₆ and ₁₂ still take horizontal space — count them.

**Pre-built classes** (already loaded in SVG widget):
- `class="t"` = sans 14px primary, `class="ts"` = sans 12px secondary, `class="th"` = sans 14px medium (500)
- `class="box"` = neutral rect helper (secondary fill, border stroke)
- `class="node"` = clickable group with hover effect (cursor pointer, slight dim on hover)
- `class="arr"` = arrow line (1.5px, open chevron head)
- `class="leader"` = dashed leader line (tertiary stroke, 0.5px, dashed)
- `class="c-{ramp}"` = colored node (c-default, c-gray, c-brown, c-orange, c-yellow, c-green, c-blue, c-purple, c-pink, c-red, plus compatibility aliases c-teal, c-amber, c-coral, c-black). Apply to `<g>` or shape element (rect/circle/ellipse), NOT to paths. Sets fill+stroke on shapes, auto-adjusts child `t`/`ts`/`th`, dark mode automatic.

**c-{ramp} nesting:** These classes use direct-child selectors (`>`). Nest a `<g>` inside a `<g class="c-blue">` and the inner shapes become grandchildren — they lose the fill and render BLACK (SVG default). Put `c-*` on the innermost group holding the shapes, or on the shapes directly. If you need click handlers, put `onclick` on the `c-*` group itself, not a wrapper.

- Short aliases: `var(--p)`, `var(--s)`, `var(--t)`, `var(--bg2)`, `var(--b)`
- Arrow marker: always include this `<defs>` at the start of every SVG:
  `<defs><marker id="arrow" viewBox="0 0 10 10" refX="8" refY="5" markerWidth="6" markerHeight="6" orient="auto-start-reverse"><path d="M2 1L8 5L2 9" fill="none" stroke="context-stroke" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/></marker></defs>`
  Then use `marker-end="url(#arrow)"` on lines. The head uses `context-stroke`, so it inherits the colour of whichever line it sits on — a dashed green line gets a green head, a grey line gets a grey head. Never a colour mismatch. Do not add filters, patterns, or extra markers to `<defs>`. Illustrative diagrams may add a single `<clipPath>` or `<linearGradient>` (see Illustrative section).

**Minimize standalone labels.** Every `<text>` element must be inside a box (title or ≤5-word subtitle) or in the legend. Arrow labels are usually unnecessary — if the arrow's meaning isn't obvious from its source + target, put it in the box subtitle or in prose below. Labels floating in space collide with things and are ambiguous.

**Stroke width:** Use 0.5px strokes for diagram borders and edges — not 1px or 2px. Thin strokes feel more refined.

**Connector paths need `fill="none"`.** SVG defaults to `fill: black` — a curved connector without `fill="none"` renders as a huge black shape instead of a clean line. Every `<path>` or `<polyline>` used as a connector/arrow MUST have `fill="none"`. Only set fill on shapes meant to be filled (rects, circles, polygons).

**Rect rounding:** `rx="4"` for subtle corners. `rx="8"` max for emphasized rounding. `rx` ≥ half the height = pill shape — deliberate only.

**Schematic containers use dashed rects with a label.** Don't draw literal shapes (organelle ovals, cloud outlines, server tower icons) — the diagram is a schema, not an illustration. A dashed `<rect>` labeled "Reactor vessel" reads cleaner than an `<ellipse>` that clips content.

**Lines stop at component edges.** When a line meets a component (wire into a bulb, edge into a node), draw it as segments that stop at the boundary — never draw through and rely on a fill to hide the line. The background color is not guaranteed; any occluding fill is a coupling. Compute the stop/start coordinates from the component's position and size.

**No freestyle SVG colors.** Even illustrative SVGs must use the theme palette only. Use `c-*` classes and the shared palette tokens; do not fall back to hardcoded hex for scenes, gradients, flames, water, heat maps, or decorative accents.

**No rotated text**. `<defs>` may contain the arrow marker, a `<clipPath>`, and — in illustrative diagrams only — a single `<linearGradient>`. Nothing else: no filters, no patterns, no extra markers.

## Mathematical SVG reference quality

Use the illustrations in `context/all-svgs` as the quality bar for math and graph-based SVGs. They are compact, editorial mathematical diagrams: precise axes, smooth curves, shaded regions, construction guides, small point markers, and only the labels needed to make the idea legible.

When the user asks for calculus, algebra, set theory, geometry, graph interpretation, or "show me what this means" with equations, prefer this style over a box-and-arrow diagram.

**What to copy from the reference set:**
- Compose around one central mathematical object: a curve, region, interval, parabola, set boundary, triangle, or approximation.
- Draw axes as thin neutral lines with arrowheads, not heavy chart frames.
- Use smooth `<path>` curves with `stroke-linecap="round"` and `stroke-linejoin="round"`.
- Use translucent or theme-token shaded regions to show area, positive/negative contribution, interval coverage, limits, or approximation.
- Add dashed construction lines for `a`, `b`, `x`, directrix, tangent, partition edges, or vertical projections.
- Add small filled point markers at important intersections and endpoints.
- Put explanatory prose outside the main plot area or keep it to 2-4 short lines with `class="ts"`.
- Prefer a single elegant figure over multiple mini-plots unless the comparison is the concept.

**Avoid low-quality math diagrams:**
- Do not turn a mathematical concept into boxes unless the user asks for a process or taxonomy.
- Do not use chart libraries for hand-explanatory math diagrams; raw SVG gives better control over axes, shaded integrals, limits, and annotations.
- Do not over-label every tick or draw a full grid by default. The reference style uses sparse labels.
- Do not make the curve jagged. Use cubic Bezier paths for conceptual curves.
- Do not use saturated fills, thick outlines, drop shadows, filters, or decorative gradients.
- Do not place labels on top of curves, shaded regions, or axes. Move labels to clear space and connect with a small leader line when needed.

**Host adaptation:** The `context/all-svgs` files use fixed pixel sizes and literal grays. In Avenire widgets, keep the same visual discipline but adapt it to the host rules: `viewBox="0 0 680 H"`, `width="100%"`, classes `t`/`ts`/`th` for text, theme tokens or `c-*` ramps for colors, no custom palette, and a transparent background.

**Reference motifs to reuse:**
- `definite-integrals-1.svg`: shaded curvilinear trapezoid under `y=f(x)` between dashed vertical bounds `a` and `b`.
- `riemann-integrability-criteria-1.svg`: interval partition with translucent rectangles under a curve.
- `fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-1.svg`: positive and negative signed areas separated by the horizontal axis.
- `quadratic-equations.svg`: parabola with axis of symmetry, directrix, vertex/focus markers, and dashed projections.
- `supremum-and-infimum-*.svg`: number-line/set-boundary diagrams with minimal labels.

**Planning block additions for math SVGs:** In the mandatory `<!-- PLAN ... -->`, include:
```text
  math object: curve | region | number line | geometric construction | approximation
  coordinate frame: axes origin, x-axis y, y-axis x, arrow extents
  highlighted region: path or rect range, fill token, label
  construction lines: dashed guides and endpoints
  label collision check: labels clear of curve/axis/shading
```

**Coordinate discipline for math figures:**
- Reserve the central 420-520px width for the mathematical figure and leave a side or lower area for short notes.
- Put axes behind curves and shaded regions only when the axis should remain visible; otherwise draw shaded regions first, axes second, curve last, labels last.
- Curves should use `stroke-width="2"` maximum; axes/guides should use `0.5` or `1`.
- Shaded areas should have no heavy border unless the boundary itself is the concept.
- Keep the bottom explanatory text outside the plot's active geometry, with at least 20px separation from axes and guide lines.
- If a diagram needs more than one paragraph of explanation, split the prose into chat text and keep the SVG visual.

## Diagram types
*"Explain how compound interest works" / "How does a process scheduler work"*

**Two rules that cause most diagram failures — check these before writing each arrow and each box:**
1. **Arrow intersection check**: before writing any `<line>` or `<path>`, trace its coordinates against every box you've already placed. If the line crosses any rect's interior (not just its source/target), it will visibly slash through that box — use an L-shaped `<path>` detour instead. This applies to arrows crossing labels too.
2. **Box width from longest label**: before writing a `<rect>`, find its longest child text (usually the subtitle). `rect_width = max(title_chars × 8, subtitle_chars × 7) + 24`. A 100px-wide box holds at most a 10-char subtitle. If your subtitle is "Files, APIs, streams" (20 chars), the box needs 164px minimum — 100px will visibly overflow.
3. **Density check**: if boxes, labels, and arrows cannot fit cleanly with the default margins and gaps, stop and split the concept into multiple diagrams. Do not squeeze.

**Tier packing:** Compute total width BEFORE placing. Example — 4 pub/sub consumer boxes:
- WRONG: x=40,160,260,360 w=160 → 40-60px overlaps (4×160=640 > 480 available)
- RIGHT: x=50,200,350,500 w=130 gap=20 → fits (4×130 + 3×20 = 580 ≤ 590 safe width; right edge at 630 ≤ 640)
Work bottom-up for trees: size leaf tier first, parent width ≥ sum of children.

**Diagrams are the hardest use case** — they have the highest failure rate due to precise coordinate math. Common mistakes: viewBox too small (content clipped), arrows through unrelated boxes, labels on arrow lines, text past viewBox edges, and over-dense layouts that should have been split. Double-check coordinates before finalizing.

Use `show_widget` with raw SVG for diagrams. The widget automatically wraps SVG output in a card.

**Pick the right diagram type.** The decision is about *intent*, not subject matter. Ask: is the user trying to *document* this, or *understand* it?

**Reference diagrams** — the user wants a map they can point at. Precision matters more than feeling. Boxes, labels, arrows, containment. These are the diagrams you'd find in documentation.
- **Flowchart** — steps in sequence, decisions branching, data transforming. Good for: approval workflows, request lifecycles, build pipelines, "what happens when I click submit". Trigger phrases: *"walk me through the process"*, *"what are the steps"*, *"what's the flow"*.
- **Structural diagram** — things inside other things. Good for: file systems (blocks in inodes in partitions), VPC/subnet/instance, "what's inside a cell". Trigger phrases: *"what's the architecture"*, *"how is this organised"*, *"where does X live"*.

**Intuition diagrams** — the user wants to *feel* how something works. The goal isn't a correct map, it's the right mental model. These should look nothing like a flowchart. The subject doesn't need a physical form — it needs a *visual metaphor*.
- **Illustrative diagram** — draw the mechanism. Physical things get cross-sections (water heaters, engines, lungs). Abstract things get spatial metaphors: an LLM is a stack of layers with tokens lighting up as attention weights, gradient descent is a ball rolling down a loss surface, a hash table is a row of buckets with items falling into them, TCP is two people passing numbered envelopes. Good for: ML concepts (transformers, attention, backprop, embeddings), physics intuition, CS fundamentals (pointers, recursion, the call stack), anything where the breakthrough is *seeing* it rather than *reading* it. Trigger phrases: *"how does X actually work"*, *"explain X"*, *"I don't get X"*, *"give me an intuition for X"*.

**Route on the verb, not the noun.** Same subject, different diagram depending on what was asked:

| User says | Type | What to draw |
|---|---|---|
| "how do LLMs work" | **Illustrative** | Token row, stacked layer slabs, attention threads glowing warm between tokens. Go interactive if you can. |
| "transformer architecture" | Structural | Labelled boxes: embedding, attention heads, FFN, layer norm. |
| "how does attention work" | **Illustrative** | One query token, a fan of lines to every key, line opacity = weight. |
| "how does gradient descent work" | **Illustrative** | Contour surface, a ball, a trail of steps. Slider for learning rate. |
| "what are the training steps" | Flowchart | Forward → loss → backward → update. Boxes and arrows. |
| "how does TCP work" | **Illustrative** | Two endpoints, numbered packets in flight, an ACK returning. |
| "TCP handshake sequence" | Flowchart | SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK. Three boxes. |
| "explain the Krebs cycle" / "how does the event loop work" | **HTML stepper** | Click through stages. Never a ring. |
| "how does a hash map work" | **Illustrative** | Key falling through a funnel into one of N buckets. |
| "draw the database schema" / "show me the ERD" | **mermaid.js** | `erDiagram` syntax. Not SVG. |

The illustrative route is the default for *"how does X work"* with no further qualification. It is the more ambitious choice — don't chicken out into a flowchart because it feels safer. Claude draws these well.

Don't mix families in one diagram. If you need both, draw the intuition version first (build the mental model), then the reference version (fill in the precise labels) as a second tool call with prose between.

**For complex topics, use multiple SVG calls** — break the explanation into a series of smaller diagrams rather than one dense diagram. Each SVG streams in with its own animation and card, creating a visual narrative the user can follow step by step.

**Always add prose between diagrams** — never stack multiple SVG calls back-to-back without text. Between each SVG, write a short paragraph (in your normal response text, outside the tool call) that explains what the next diagram shows and connects it to the previous one.

**Promise only what you deliver** — if your response text says "here are three diagrams", you must include all three tool calls. Never promise a follow-up diagram and omit it. If you can only fit one diagram, adjust your text to match. One complete diagram is better than three promised and one delivered.

#### Flowchart

For sequential processes, cause-and-effect, decision trees.

**Planning**: Size boxes to fit their text generously. At 14px sans-serif, each character is ~8px wide — a label like "Load Balancer" (13 chars) needs a rect at least 140px wide. When in doubt, make boxes wider and leave more space between them. Cramped diagrams are the most common failure mode.

**Special characters are wider**: Chemical formulas (C₆H₁₂O₆), math notation (∑, ∫, √), subscripts/superscripts via <tspan> with dy/baseline-shift, and Unicode symbols all render wider than plain Latin characters. For labels containing formulas or special notation, add 30-50% extra width to your estimate. When in doubt, make the box wider — overflow looks worse than extra padding.

**Spacing**: 60px minimum between boxes, 24px padding inside boxes, 12px between text and edges. Leave 10px gap between arrowheads and box edges. Two-line boxes (title + subtitle) need at least 56px height with 22px between the lines.

**Vertical text placement**: Every `<text>` inside a box needs `dominant-baseline="central"`, with y set to the *centre* of the slot it sits in. Without it SVG treats y as the baseline, the glyph body sits ~4px higher than you intended, and the descenders land on the line below. Formula: for text centred in a rect at (x, y, w, h), use `<text x={x+w/2} y={y+h/2} text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">`. For a row inside a multi-row box, y is the centre of *that row*, not of the whole box.

**Layout**: Prefer single-direction flows (all top-down or all left-right). Keep diagrams simple — max 4-5 nodes per diagram. The widget is narrow (~680px) so complex layouts break.

**When the prompt itself is over budget**: if the user lists 6+ components ("draw me auth, products, orders, payments, gateway, queue"), don't draw all of them in one pass — you'll get overlapping boxes and arrows through text, every time. Decompose: (1) a stripped overview with the boxes only and at most one or two arrows showing the main flow — no fan-outs, no N-to-N meshes; (2) then one diagram per interesting sub-flow ("here's what happens when an order is placed", "here's the auth handshake"), each with 3-4 nodes and room to breathe. Count the nouns before you draw. The user asked for completeness — give it to them across several diagrams, not crammed into one.

**Cycles don't get drawn as rings.** If the last stage feeds back into the first (Krebs cycle, event loop, GC mark-and-sweep, TCP retransmit), your instinct is to place the stages around a circle. Don't. Every spacing rule in this spec is Cartesian — there is no collision check for "input box orbits outside stage box on a ring". You will get satellite boxes overlapping the stages they feed, labels sitting on the dashed circle, and tangential arrows that point nowhere. The ring is decoration; the loop is conveyed by the return arrow.

Build a stepper in `show_widget` HTML. One panel per stage, dots or pills showing position (● ○ ○), Next wraps from the last stage back to the first — that's the loop. Each panel owns its inputs and products: an event loop's pending callbacks live *inside* the Poll panel, not floating next to a box on a ring. Nothing collides because nothing shares the canvas. Only fall back to a linear SVG (stages in a row, curved `<path>` return arrow) when there's one input and one output total and no per-stage detail to show.

**Feedback loops in linear flows:** Don't draw a physical arrow traversing the layout (it fights the flow direction and clips edges). Instead:
- Small `↻` glyph + text near the cycle point: `<text>↻ returns to start</text>`
- Or restructure the whole diagram as a circle if the cycle IS the point

**Arrows:** A line from A to B must not cross any other box or label. If the direct path crosses something, route around with an L-bend: `<path d="M x1 y1 L x1 ymid L x2 ymid L x2 y2"/>`. Place arrow labels in clear space, not on the midpoint.

Keep all nodes the same height when they have the same content type (e.g. all single-line boxes = 44px, all two-line boxes = 56px).

**Flowchart components** — use these patterns consistently:

*Single-line node* (44px tall): title only. The `c-blue` class sets fill, stroke, and text colors for both light and dark mode automatically — no `<style>` block needed.
```svg
<!-- PLAN
  type: flowchart
  nodes: [(T-cells, 7 chars, 136px)]
  row widths: single box only
  viewBox H: 64 + 40 = 104
  label side: right (default)
  color ramp: c-blue for node
-->
<g class="node c-blue" onclick="sendPrompt('Tell me more about T-cells')">
  <rect x="100" y="20" width="180" height="44" rx="8" stroke-width="0.5"/>
  <text class="th" x="190" y="42" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">T-cells</text>
</g>
```

*Two-line node* (56px tall): bold title + muted subtitle.
```svg
<!-- PLAN
  type: flowchart
  nodes: [(Dendritic cells, 15 chars, 200px)]
  row widths: single box only
  viewBox H: 76 + 40 = 116
  label side: right (default)
  color ramp: c-blue for node
-->
<g class="node c-blue" onclick="sendPrompt('Tell me more about dendritic cells')">
  <rect x="100" y="20" width="200" height="56" rx="8" stroke-width="0.5"/>
  <text class="th" x="200" y="38" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">Dendritic cells</text>
  <text class="ts" x="200" y="56" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">Detect foreign antigens</text>
</g>
```

*Connector* (no label — meaning is clear from source + target):
```svg
<!-- PLAN
  type: flowchart
  nodes: [(connector, 9 chars, 112px)]
  row widths: single arrow segment
  viewBox H: 120 + 40 = 160
  label side: right (default)
  color ramp: neutral gray for connector
-->
<line x1="200" y1="76" x2="200" y2="120" class="arr" marker-end="url(#arrow)"/>
```

*Neutral node* (gray, for start/end/generic steps): use `class="box"` for the provided neutral fill/stroke helper, and default text classes.

Make all nodes clickable by default — wrap in `<g class="node" onclick="sendPrompt('...')">`. The hover effect is built in.

**Few-shot SVG examples:** prepend a `<!-- PLAN ... -->` block before every raw SVG example, including inline SVG inside HTML examples.

#### Structural diagram

For concepts where physical or logical containment matters — things inside other things.

**When to use**: The explanation depends on *where* processes happen. Examples: how a cell works (organelles inside a cell), how a file system works (blocks inside inodes inside partitions), how a building's HVAC works (ducts inside floors inside a building), how a CPU cache hierarchy works (L1 inside core, L2 shared).

**Core idea**: Large rounded rects are containers. Smaller rects inside them are regions or sub-structures. Text labels describe what happens in each region. Arrows show flow between regions or from external inputs/outputs.

**Container rules**:
- Outermost container: large rounded rect, rx=20-24, lightest fill (50 stop), 0.5px stroke (600 stop). Label at top-left inside, 14px bold.
- Inner regions: medium rounded rects, rx=8-12, next shade fill (100-200 stop). Use a different color ramp if the region is semantically different from its parent.
- 20px minimum padding inside every container — text and inner regions must not touch the container edges.
- Max 2-3 nesting levels. Deeper nesting gets unreadable at 680px width.

**Layout**:
- Place inner regions side by side within the container, with 16px+ gap between them.
- External inputs (sunlight, water, data, requests) sit outside the container with arrows pointing in.
- External outputs sit outside with arrows pointing out.
- Keep external labels short — one word or a short phrase. Details go in the prose between diagrams.

**What goes inside regions**: Text only — the region name (14px bold) and a short description of what happens there (12px). Don't put flowchart-style boxes inside regions. Don't draw illustrations or icons inside.

**Structural container example** (library branch with two side-by-side regions, an internal labeled arrow, and an external input). ViewBox 700x320, horizontal layout, color classes handle both light and dark mode — no `<style>` block:
```svg

  ]

<line x1="75" y1="185" x2="118" y2="185" class="arr" marker-end="url(#arrow)"/>
```

**Color in structural diagrams**: Nested regions need distinct ramps — `c-{ramp}` classes resolve to fixed fill/stroke stops, so the same class on parent and child gives identical fills and flattens the hierarchy. Pick a *related* ramp for inner structures (e.g. Green for the library envelope, Teal for the circulation desk inside it) and a *contrasting* ramp for a region that does something functionally different (e.g. Amber for the reading room). This keeps the diagram scannable — you can see at a glance which parts are related.

**Database schemas / ERDs — use mermaid.js, not SVG.** A schema table is a header plus N field rows plus typed columns plus crow's-foot connectors. That is a text-layout problem and hand-placing it in SVG fails the same way every time. mermaid.js `erDiagram` does layout, cardinality, and connector routing for free. ERDs only; everything else stays in SVG.

```
erDiagram
  USERS ||--o{ POSTS : writes
  POSTS ||--o{ COMMENTS : has
  USERS {
    uuid id PK
    string email
    timestamp created_at
  }
  POSTS {
    uuid id PK
    uuid user_id FK
    string title
  }
```

Use `show_widget` with HTML for ERDs. Import and initialize in a `<script type="module">`. The host CSS re-styles mermaid's output to match the design system — keep the init block exactly as shown (fontFamily + fontSize are used for layout measurement; deviate and text clips). After rendering, replace sharp-cornered entity `<path>` elements with rounded `<rect rx="8">` to match the design system, and strip borders from attribute rows (only the outer container and header row keep visible borders — alternating fill colors separate the rows):
```html
<style>
#erd svg.erDiagram .divider path { stroke-opacity: 0.5; }
#erd svg.erDiagram .row-rect-odd path,
#erd svg.erDiagram .row-rect-odd rect,

#erd svg.erDiagram .row-rect-even rect { stroke: none !important; }

const dark = matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches;
await document.fonts.ready;

    lineColor: dark ? '#9c9a92' : '#73726c',
    textColor: dark ? '#c2c0b6' : '#3d3d3a',
  },
});
const { svg } = await mermaid.render('erd-svg', `erDiagram
  USERS ||--o{ POSTS : writes
  POSTS ||--o{ COMMENTS : has`);
document.getElementById('erd').innerHTML = svg;

// Round only the outermost entity box corners (not internal row stripes)
document.querySelectorAll('#erd svg.erDiagram .node').forEach(node => {
  const firstPath = node.querySelector('path[d]');
  if (!firstPath) return;
  const d = firstPath.getAttribute('d');
  const nums = d.match(/-?[\d.]+/g)?.map(Number);
  if (!nums || nums.length < 8) return;
  const xs = [nums[0], nums[2], nums[4], nums[6]];
  const ys = [nums[1], nums[3], nums[5], nums[7]];
  const x = Math.min(...xs), y = Math.min(...ys);
  const w = Math.max(...xs) - x, h = Math.max(...ys) - y;
  const rect = document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', 'rect');
  rect.setAttribute('x', x); rect.setAttribute('y', y);
  rect.setAttribute('width', w); rect.setAttribute('height', h);
  rect.setAttribute('rx', '8');
  for (const a of ['fill', 'stroke', 'stroke-width', 'class', 'style']) {
    if (firstPath.hasAttribute(a)) rect.setAttribute(a, firstPath.getAttribute(a));
  }
  firstPath.replaceWith(rect);
});

// Strip borders from attribute rows (mermaid v11: .row-rect-odd / .row-rect-even)
document.querySelectorAll('#erd svg.erDiagram .row-rect-odd path, #erd svg.erDiagram .row-rect-even path').forEach(p => {
  p.setAttribute('stroke', 'none');
});
</script>
```

Works identically for `classDiagram` — swap the diagram source; init stays the same.

#### Illustrative diagram

For building *intuition*. The subject might be physical (an engine, a lung) or completely abstract (attention, recursion, gradient descent) — what matters is that a spatial drawing conveys the mechanism better than labelled boxes would. These are the diagrams that make someone go "oh, *that's* what it's doing."

**Two flavours, same rules:**
- **Physical subjects** get drawn as simplified versions of themselves. Cross-sections, cutaways, schematics. A water heater is a tank with a burner underneath. A lung is a branching tree in a cavity. You're drawing *the thing*, stylised.
- **Abstract subjects** get drawn as *spatial metaphors*. You're inventing a shape for something that doesn't have one — but the shape should make the mechanism obvious. A transformer is a stack of horizontal slabs with a bright thread of attention connecting tokens across layers. A hash function is a funnel scattering items into a row of buckets. The call stack is literally a stack of frames growing and shrinking. Embeddings are dots clustering in space. The metaphor *is* the explanation.

This is the most ambitious diagram type and the one Claude is best at. Lean into it. Use colour for intensity (a hot attention weight glows amber, a cold one stays gray). Use repetition for scale (many small circles = many parameters).

**Prefer interactive over static.** A static cross-section is a good answer; a cross-section you can *operate* is a great one. The decision rule: if the real-world system has a control, give the diagram that control. A water heater has a thermostat — so give the user a slider that shifts the hot/cold boundary, a toggle that fires the burner and animates convection currents. An LLM has input tokens — let the user click one and watch the attention weights re-fan. A cache has a hit rate — let them drag it and watch latency change. Reach for `show_widget` HTML with inline SVG first; only fall back to static raw SVG when there's genuinely nothing to twiddle.

**When NOT to use**: The user is asking for a *reference*, not an *intuition*. "What are the components of a transformer" wants labelled boxes — that's a structural diagram. "Walk me through our CI pipeline" wants sequential steps — that's a flowchart. Also skip this when the metaphor would be arbitrary rather than revealing: drawing "the cloud" as a cloud shape or "microservices" as little houses doesn't teach anything about how they work. If the drawing doesn't make the *mechanism* clearer, don't draw it.

**Fidelity ceiling**: These are schematics, not illustrations. Every shape should read at a glance. If a `<path>` needs more than ~6 segments to draw, simplify it. A tank is a rounded rect, not a Bézier portrait of a tank. A flame is three triangles, not a fire. Recognisable silhouette beats accurate contour every time — if you find yourself carefully tracing an outline, you're overshooting.

**Core principle**: Draw the mechanism, not a diagram *about* the mechanism. Spatial arrangement carries the meaning; labels annotate. A good illustrative diagram works with the labels removed.

**What changes from flowchart/structural rules**:

- **Shapes are freeform.** Use `<path>`, `<ellipse>`, `<circle>`, `<polygon>`, and curved lines to represent real forms. A water tank is a tall rect with rounded bottom. A heart valve is a pair of curved paths. A circuit trace is a thin polyline. You are not limited to rounded rects.
- **Layout follows the subject's geometry**, not a grid. If the thing is tall and narrow (a water heater, a thermometer), the diagram is tall and narrow. If it's wide and flat (a PCB, a geological cross-section), the diagram is wide. Let the subject dictate proportions within the 680px viewBox width.
- **Color encodes intensity**, not category. For physical subjects: warm ramps (amber, coral, red) = heat/energy/pressure, cool ramps (blue, teal) = cold/calm, gray = inert structure. For abstract subjects: warm = active/high-weight/attended-to, cool or gray = dormant/low-weight/ignored. A user should be able to glance at the diagram and see *where the action is* without reading a single label.
- **Layering and overlap are encouraged — for shapes.** Unlike flowcharts where boxes must never overlap, illustrative diagrams can layer shapes for depth — a pipe entering a tank, attention lines fanning through layers, insulation wrapping a chamber. Use z-ordering (later in source = on top) deliberately.
- **Text is the exception — never let a stroke cross it.** The overlap permission is for shapes only. Every label needs 8px of clear air between its baseline/cap-height and the nearest stroke. Don't solve this with a background rect — solve it by *placing the text somewhere else*. Labels go in the quiet regions: above the drawing, below it, in the margin with a leader line, or in the gap between two fans of lines. If there is no quiet region, the drawing is too dense — remove something or split into two diagrams.
- **Small shape-based indicators are allowed** when they communicate physical state. Triangles for flames. Circles for bubbles or particles. Wavy lines for steam or heat radiation. Parallel lines for vibration. These aren't decoration — they tell the user what's happening physically. Keep them simple: basic SVG primitives, not detailed illustrations.
- **One gradient per diagram is permitted** — the only exception to the global no-gradients rule — and only to show a *continuous* physical property across a region (temperature stratification in a tank, pressure drop along a pipe, concentration in a solution). It must be a single `<linearGradient>` between exactly two stops from the same colour ramp. No radial gradients, no multi-stop fades, no gradient-as-aesthetic. If two stacked flat-fill rects communicate the same thing, do that instead.
- **Animation is permitted for interactive HTML versions.** Use CSS `@keyframes` animating only `transform` and `opacity`. Keep loops under ~2s, and wrap every animation in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` so it's opt-out by default. Animations should show how the system *behaves* — convection current, rotation, flow — not just move for the sake of moving. No physics engines or heavy libraries.

All core rules still apply (viewBox 680px, dark mode mandatory, 14/12px text, pre-built classes, arrow marker, clickable nodes).

**Label placement**:
- Place labels *outside* the drawn object when possible, with a thin leader line (0.5px dashed, `var(--t)` stroke) pointing to the relevant part. This keeps the illustration uncluttered.
- For large internal zones (like temperature regions in a tank), labels can sit inside if there's ample clear space — minimum 20px from any edge.
- External labels sit in the margin area or above/below the object. **Pick one side for labels and put them all there** — at 680px wide you don't have room for a drawing *and* label columns on both sides. Reserve at least 140px of horizontal margin on the label side. Labels on the left are the ones that clip: `text-anchor="end"` extends leftward from x, and with multi-line callouts it's very easy to blow past x=0 without noticing. Default to right-side labels with `text-anchor="start"` unless the subject's geometry forces otherwise. Use `class="ts"` (12px) for callouts, `class="th"` (14px medium) for major component names.

**Composition approach**:
1. Start with the main object's silhouette — the largest shape, centered in the viewBox.
2. Add internal structure: chambers, pipes, membranes, mechanical parts.
3. Add external connections: pipes entering/exiting, arrows showing flow direction, labels for inputs and outputs.
4. Add state indicators last: color fills showing temperature/pressure/concentration, small animated elements showing movement or energy.
5. Leave generous whitespace around the object for labels — don't crowd annotations against the viewBox edges.

**Static vs interactive**: Static cutaways and cross-sections work best as pure raw SVG in `show_widget`. If the diagram benefits from controls — a slider that changes a temperature zone, buttons toggling between operating states, live readouts — use `show_widget` HTML with inline SVG for the drawing and HTML controls around it.

**Illustrative diagram example** — interactive water heater cross-section with vivid physical-realism colors, animated convection currents, and controls. Uses `show_widget` HTML with inline SVG: a thermostat slider shifts the hot/cold gradient boundary, a heating toggle animates flames on/off and transitions convection to paused. viewBox is 680x560; tank occupies x=180..440, leaving 140px+ of right margin for labels. Smooth convection paths use `stroke-dasharray:5 5` at ~1.6s for a gentle flow feel. A warm-glow overlay on the hot zone pulses subtly when heating is on. Flame shapes use warm gradient fills and clean opacity transitions. Labels sit along the right margin with leader lines.

Note what's *not* here: no boxes labelled "multi-head attention", no arrows labelled "Q/K/V". Those belong in the structural diagram. This one is about the *feeling* of attention — one token looking at every other token with varying intensity.

These are starting points, not ceilings. For the water heater: add a thermostat slider, animate the convection current, toggle heating vs standby. For the attention diagram: let the user click any token to become the query, scrub through layers, animate the weights settling. The goal is always to *show* how the thing works, not just *label* it.

## Charts

Use `widget: { type: "spec", spec: ... }` for normal charts and analytical canvases. Bar, line, and area charts belong in spec widgets, especially when paired with stats, tables, sections, progress rows, or callouts. The app renders these with native React/Recharts components and the shared UI theme.

Use raw Chart.js in `widget: { type: "code", code: ... }` only when the request needs a chart type not covered by primitives, custom plugin behavior, imperative interaction, multiple synchronized canvases, or highly custom annotations. Do not use Chart.js for ordinary dashboards.

For spec charts:
- Include a specific title.
- Use rounded display values.
- Pair important charts with a small stat grid or callout when it improves scanning.
- Use `table` nodes for supporting artifact data; use markdown tables only for small tables in a normal prose answer.
- Keep series count small enough to read at chat width.

## Raw Chart.js fallback

```html
<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 300px;">
  <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
</div>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/4.4.1/chart.umd.js" onload="initChart()"></script>
<script>
  function initChart() {
    new Chart(document.getElementById('myChart'), {
      type: 'bar',
      data: { labels: ['Q1','Q2','Q3','Q4'], datasets: [{ label: 'Revenue', data: [12,19,8,15] }] },
      options: { responsive: true, maintainAspectRatio: false }
    });
  }
  if (window.Chart) initChart();
</script>
```

Rules for raw Chart.js only:
- Canvas cannot resolve CSS variables. Use hardcoded hex or Chart.js defaults.
- Wrap `<canvas>` in `<div>` with explicit `height` and `position: relative`.
- **Canvas sizing**: set height ONLY on the wrapper div, never on the canvas element itself. Use position: relative on the wrapper and responsive: true, maintainAspectRatio: false in Chart.js options. Never set CSS height directly on canvas — this causes wrong dimensions, especially for horizontal bar charts.
- For horizontal bar charts: wrapper div height should be at least (number_of_bars * 40) + 80 pixels.
- Load UMD build via `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/...">` — sets `window.Chart` global. Follow with plain `<script>` (no `type="module"`).
- **Script load ordering**: CDN scripts may not be loaded when the next `<script>` runs (especially during streaming). Always use `onload="initChart()"` on the CDN script tag, define your chart init in a named function, and add `if (window.Chart) initChart();` as a fallback at the end of your inline script. This guarantees charts render regardless of load order.
- Multiple charts: use unique IDs (`myChart1`, `myChart2`). Each gets its own canvas+div pair.
- For bubble and scatter charts: bubble radii extend past their center points, so points near axis boundaries get clipped. Pad the scale range — set `scales.y.min` and `scales.y.max` ~10% beyond your data range (same for x). Or use `layout: { padding: 20 }` as a blunt fallback.
- Chart.js auto-skips x-axis labels when they'd overlap. If you have ≤12 categories and need all labels visible (waterfall, monthly series), set `scales.x.ticks: { autoSkip: false, maxRotation: 45 }` — missing labels make bars unidentifiable.

**Number formatting**: negative values are `-$5M` not `$-5M` — sign before currency symbol. Use a formatter: `(v) => (v < 0 ? '-' : '') + '$' + Math.abs(v) + 'M'`.

**Legends** — always disable Chart.js default and build custom HTML. The default uses round dots and no values; custom HTML gives small squares, tight spacing, and percentages:

```js
plugins: { legend: { display: false } }
```

```html
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 16px; margin-bottom: 8px; font-size: 12px; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">
  <span style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 4px;"><span style="width: 10px; height: 10px; border-radius: 2px; background: #3266ad;"></span>Chrome 65%</span>
  <span style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 4px;"><span style="width: 10px; height: 10px; border-radius: 2px; background: #73726c;"></span>Safari 18%</span>
</div>
```

Include the value/percentage in each label when the data is categorical (pie, donut, single-series bar). Position the legend above the chart (`margin-bottom`) or below (`margin-top`) — not inside the canvas.

For dashboard layout, prefer spec widgets with stats above the chart and supporting details below it. Use raw Chart.js only after the primitive chart cannot represent the requested behavior.

## Physics Simulation Module

Use this module for simulations where motion over time is the point: orbits, pendulums, waves, fields, energy exchange, and other systems with changing state. The output should feel like one purpose-built widget, not a collage of unrelated sections.

### Layout
- Put the main canvas on top.
- Put the explanation and controls beneath the canvas.
- Stack those sections vertically on mobile.
- Split them into two columns on wider screens.
- Left bottom column: a short explanation, one or two sentences max.
- Right bottom column: sliders, toggles, buttons, and live readouts.
- Use a second canvas only when the system genuinely benefits from a companion view such as phase space or energy.
- Do not let the main canvas feel like a dark blank card with faint marks. The simulated system should occupy the canvas, use readable contrast, and include enough labels or legends for the viewer to understand what is moving and what is being measured.

### Canonical layout
```html
<div class="phys-sim-layout">
  <div class="phys-sim-canvas">
    <canvas id="sim"></canvas>
  </div>

  <div class="phys-sim-bottom">
    <div class="phys-sim-copy">
      <h2>Title</h2>
      <p>Short explanation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="phys-sim-controls">
      <!-- sliders, toggles, buttons, readouts -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<style>
  .phys-sim-layout {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 16px;
    padding: 1rem 0;
  }

  .phys-sim-canvas {
    height: clamp(320px, 55vh, 560px);
    min-width: 0;
  }

  .phys-sim-canvas canvas {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: block;

    background: var(--color-background-secondary);
  }

    border-radius: 8px;
    padding: 14px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 14px;
  }

  @media (min-width: 720px) {
    .phys-sim-layout {
      gap: 20px;
    }

    .phys-sim-bottom {
      grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr) minmax(280px, 360px);
      gap: 24px;
    }
  }
</style>
```

### Control rules
- Include sliders for almost all meaningful factors.
- Use toggles or buttons for mode switches, visibility, reset, pause, and demo controls.
- Do not rely on checkbox rendering. Use button-style toggles or segmented controls instead.
- Use bare `<button>`, `<input type="range">`, and `<select>` elements unless a custom layout is required. Do not repaint simulation controls with custom blue fills or bespoke button chrome; the host already styles controls.
- Put each slider in a three-part row: label, slider, rounded value. Keep labels and values aligned with `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 72px minmax(0, 1fr) 48px; gap: 10px; align-items: center;`.
- Use a compact button row for actions such as reset, pause, drop, or clear. Primary simulation actions can come first, but they should still use the native button treatment rather than custom color fills.
- Do not rely on KaTeX or math rendering in the widget. Use plain text labels, Unicode symbols, or simple inline text.
- Every control should expose a real model variable: `g`, `m`, `k`, length, damping, amplitude, frequency, charge, speed, separation, mass ratio, initial angle, and similar values.
- Round every displayed number with `Math.round()`, `.toFixed()`, or `toLocaleString()`.
- If a control changes a physical parameter, the user should be able to drag it directly.

### Scaling and navigation
- Fit the whole system into the canvas intelligently.
- If the content risks clipping, automatically reduce scale or recenter before the user notices.
- If there is any doubt about fit, add zoom in and zoom out buttons.
- Support dragging to pan when the scene is wider or taller than the view.
- Use those controls sparingly, but make them available whenever a simulation can grow beyond the default frame.
- Keep the main subject readable at all times; do not force the user to guess where the important object went.

### Complex visualizations
- For complex systems like the double pendulum, include a companion phase diagram.
- Let the user choose the phase axes instead of hard-coding them.
- Common axis choices include angle, angular velocity, position, momentum, energy, or any other state variables that make sense for the system.
- Keep the phase plot legible and synchronized with the main simulation.
- If the phase plot is not helping the explanation, leave it out.

### Visual stability
- Keep the simulation palette stable across wavelength, frequency, and parameter changes.
- Do not let the user’s choice leak into the surrounding app chrome or outer widget background.
- For YDSE and similar optics simulations, wavelength may change fringe spacing, intensity, or the appearance of the light itself, but it should not recolor the whole interface or make the widget feel detached from the app.
- Treat the widget chrome as constant and the physics as the only thing that changes.

### Simulation rules
- Represent state explicitly instead of hiding it in canvas globals.
- Use fixed-step integration. `requestAnimationFrame` drives rendering, not physics.
- If the visual shows collisions, contacts, bouncing, constraints, or barriers, the simulation must implement those interactions in state update code. Do not draw obstacles as decoration while particles pass through them.
- Use substeps or continuous collision checks when particles move fast enough to tunnel through pegs, walls, or barriers in one frame.
- After resolving collisions, enforce non-overlap: distance between two circular bodies must be at least `r1 + r2`, and distance from a particle center to a peg must be at least `particleRadius + pegRadius`. Push the particle out along the collision normal before applying bounce velocity.
- For peg-board, pachinko, Galton board, molecular, billiard, granular, or crowd-style simulations, collisions are the core concept. Use explicit circle-vs-circle and circle-vs-wall collision resolution, add damping/friction only after separation, and clamp velocities to avoid unstable jitter.
- When many objects would make real physics expensive, reduce the active object count, aggregate inactive objects into bins, or render trails/history. Do not fake collisions by letting objects overlap.
- Use RK4 for coupled or chaotic systems. Do not fall back to Euler for double pendulums, orbital mechanics, or anything sensitive to drift.
- Use Verlet only for simple orbit-style motion when it produces the cleanest result.
- Keep units consistent and label them in plain text.
- Expose the real control variables the user would actually want to adjust.
- Clamp extreme values so the sim never explodes into `NaN`.
- Include reset and pause controls when the system has memory or chaos.
- Add trails, phase plots, or envelope curves only when they help the explanation.
- Use `sendPrompt()` for follow-up actions that benefit from chat reasoning, not for deterministic UI filtering or arithmetic.

### Canvas rules
- Size the canvas to the available space and scene, then scale by `devicePixelRatio` for crisp rendering.
- Draw using visible contrast, not default black. Canvas backgrounds, pegs, paths, bars, particles, axes, and labels must use the theme colors from `updateTheme()` and remain legible in dark mode.
- Make primary simulation geometry large enough to read: balls/particles at least 5px radius when possible, pegs/markers at least 3px radius, axes at least 1.5px, and important paths at least 2px. If the scene has many marks, use alpha sparingly but never so low that marks disappear.
- Leave measured padding inside the canvas and scale the scene to fit. For triangular lattices, fields, or orbit paths, calculate bounds first and center the active area instead of hard-coding coordinates.
- Label the important quantities directly on the canvas or in an adjacent readout: totals, current active count, axis meaning, distribution bins, energy, phase axes, or units. Avoid unlabeled numeric ticks.
- **CRITICAL: Reactive Theming**: Use a helper to sync colors from CSS variables and redraw whenever the host theme changes. Prefer the canvas theme contract exposed by `WidgetRenderer`:
  ```javascript
  let colors = {};

  function updateTheme() {
    const style = getComputedStyle(document.documentElement);
    colors.bg = style.getPropertyValue('--canvas-background').trim() || style.getPropertyValue('--background').trim() || '#ffffff';
    colors.surface = style.getPropertyValue('--canvas-surface').trim() || style.getPropertyValue('--card').trim() || '#ffffff';
    colors.text = style.getPropertyValue('--canvas-text').trim() || style.getPropertyValue('--foreground').trim() || '#37352f';
    colors.muted = style.getPropertyValue('--canvas-muted').trim() || style.getPropertyValue('--muted-foreground').trim() || '#9b9a97';
    colors.border = style.getPropertyValue('--canvas-border').trim() || style.getPropertyValue('--border').trim() || 'rgba(55, 53, 47, 0.09)';
    colors.primary = style.getPropertyValue('--canvas-primary').trim() || style.getPropertyValue('--primary').trim() || '#abcfff';
    colors.grid = style.getPropertyValue('--canvas-grid').trim() || 'rgba(0,0,0,0.08)';
  }

  updateTheme();
  window.addEventListener('avenire:themechange', () => {
    updateTheme();
    draw();
  });
  ```
- Use `ResizeObserver` to reflow cleanly.
- Use `IntersectionObserver` or an equivalent visibility check to pause animation off-screen.
- Keep drawing code in CSS pixels after scaling the context.
- Draw the primary object, then supporting annotations, then labels.
- Avoid decorative effects that make the sim harder to read mid-stream.

### Simulation polish checklist
- The first rendered frame should be useful before any animation starts.
- The canvas should not be mostly empty unless emptiness is the concept being taught.
- All user-visible counters and slider values should update immediately after interaction.
- Pause and reset should be obvious from state: the button label or adjacent readout must reflect whether the sim is running.
- If random sampling is involved, show the distribution or accumulating result with clear bins, bars, or counts, not only moving particles.
- If the widget draws colliders, inspect the update loop before calling `show_widget`: every drawn collider must appear in the collision loop, every collision must separate overlapping bodies, and no state update may permit a particle to remain inside a peg, wall, or bin divider.
- Prefer a simple correctness invariant in code comments or variable names over visual guesswork: `minDistance = ball.r + peg.r`, `overlap = minDistance - distance`, `ball.x += normal.x * overlap`.
- The final code should be self-auditable from source. Do not require a screenshot, browser devtools, or pixel inspection to prove that collisions, bounds, and controls are wired.

### Common recipes

#### Kepler orbit
- Show the star at the true focus, not the center.
- Draw the planet, trail, optional velocity vector, and optional sweep area.
- Use eccentricity and speed controls.
- Add zoom and drag if the orbit can leave the frame.
- Let the user see how the orbit changes as the parameters change.

#### Double pendulum
- Show two arms, two bobs, and a fading trail for the second bob.
- RK4 is mandatory.
- Include damping, reset, pause, and sensitivity controls.
- Include a phase plot or second canvas.
- Let the user choose the phase axes, such as `θ1 vs θ2`, `θ1 vs ω1`, or `ω1 vs ω2`.
- If you include a chaos demo, use a ghost pendulum with a tiny initial offset and a different trail color.

#### Waves and harmonics
- Show superposition, standing-wave nodes and antinodes, or beat envelopes.
- Use frequency, amplitude, wavelength, or harmonic controls.
- Keep the visual language simple: curves, phase labels, and one or two highlight colors.

#### Fields and forces
- Show vector fields, trajectories, or force arrows derived from superposition.
- Let the user place or adjust sources when it materially improves understanding.
- Use field lines only if they are cleaner than arrows.

#### Energy views
- Pair the physical system with an energy panel when the conservation story matters.
- Show kinetic, potential, and total energy as bars or readouts.
- Make the total obvious: flat when ideal, decaying when damping is on.

### Typical outputs
- Orbit request: one main canvas with a focal star, moving body, trail, and a couple of toggles.
- Pendulum request: one main canvas with controlled motion, readouts, and phase/chaos support if relevant.
- Wave request: one canvas with layered curves and an envelope or node markers.
- Field request: one canvas with vectors or lines and placeable sources.

### What not to do
- Do not mix this module with the old “layout skeleton” plus separate “per-simulation specs” format.
- Do not turn the output into a generic dashboard with too many unrelated cards.
- Do not hide the state behind a library when a small handwritten integrator is enough.
- Do not use raw floats in labels.
- Do not add a second canvas unless it meaningfully changes the explanation.
- Do not use checkbox UI or KaTeX-dependent equation blocks in this module.

## Art and illustration
*"Draw me a sunset" / "Create a geometric pattern"*

Use `show_widget` with raw SVG. Same technical rules (viewBox, safe area) but the aesthetic is different:
- Fill the canvas — art should feel rich, not sparse
- Use the existing semantic ramps and classes only. Do not introduce freestyle colors.
- Do not add custom `<style>` color blocks or your own palette.
- Layer overlapping opaque shapes for depth
- Organic forms with `<path>` curves, `<ellipse>`, `<circle>`
- Texture via repetition (parallel lines, dots, hatching) not raster effects
- Geometric patterns with `<g transform="rotate()">` for radial symmetry
